# Secure_Delete
An application that leaves no traces to recover!

 ## How to run the app
   1. Either fork or download the app and open the folder.
   2. Navigate in the folder to `Secure_Delete > bin > Debug`.
   3. Run the `Secure_Delete.exe`.
 
 ## How to use the app
 - We simply select the file that we want to delete then ... 
 - We have 2 options:
    - A: Use my method of secure delete(that works with filling the file with 0's and then it deletes it).
    - B: Use the [Sdelete](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete) (I just added this option because I wanted to test it.)  
 - NOTE: When using the Sdelet you must select it where you have unpacked it or simply use the source I have provided in the Sdelete folder.
 
 ## Features
 - Deleting files so they cant be recoverd.
 - A option to use Microsofts [Sdelete](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete).
